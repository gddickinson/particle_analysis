  - Support for particle disappearance and reappearance
  - Track quality control and filtering
  - Visualization of tracking results

- **Comprehensive Motion Analysis**
  - Mean Square Displacement (MSD) analysis
  - Diffusion coefficient calculation
  - Motion type classification (confined, normal, directed, anomalous)
  - Track shape analysis (radius of gyration, asymmetry, fractal dimension)

- **User-Friendly Interface**
  - Interactive visualization of particles and tracks
  - Real-time parameter adjustment

  - Batch processing capabilities

## Installation

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n particle_analysis python=3.11
conda activate particle_analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

1. Launch the application:
```bash
python -m particle_analysis
```

2. Load data:
   - Click "Open File" to load a TIFF stack
   - Adjust contrast using the histogram sliders
   - Select a region of interest (optional)

3. Detect and track particles:
   - Adjust detection parameters if needed
   - Click "Detect Particles" to identify particles
   - Click "Track Particles" to create trajectories
   - Or use "Analyze Full Image" for complete analysis

4. Analyze results:
   - View tracks in the Visualization tab
   - Examine feature distributions in the Analysis tab
   - Export results using File â†’ Save Results

## Usage Examples

```python
# Programmatic usage
from particle_analysis.core import ParticleDetector, ParticleTracker
from particle_analysis.io import DataReader

# Load data
reader = DataReader()
movie = reader.read_movie('example.tif')

# Detect particles
detector = ParticleDetector(min_sigma=1.0, max_sigma=3.0)
particles = detector.detect_movie(movie)

# Track particles
tracker = ParticleTracker(max_distance=5.0, max_gap=2)
tracks = tracker.track_particles(particles)
```

## Technical Details

### Particle Detection

The detection algorithm employs a multi-scale Gaussian fitting approach:
1. Background estimation using median filtering
2. Local maxima detection with SNR thresholding
3. Sub-pixel localization through 2D Gaussian fitting
4. Quality control based on fit parameters

### Tracking Algorithm

Particle linking is performed using a nearest-neighbor approach with the following steps:
1. Frame-to-frame particle assignment using KDTree
2. Gap closing for temporary disappearances
3. Track initialization and termination
4. Track quality filtering

### Motion Analysis

Track analysis includes:
- MSD calculation and curve fitting
- Diffusion coefficient estimation
- Anomalous diffusion exponent calculation
- Shape descriptors computation
- Motion type classification

## Data Format

The application accepts:
- Input: TIFF stacks (.tif, .tiff)
- Output: CSV files containing:
  - Particle positions and intensities
  - Track coordinates and features
  - Analysis results
